Buck-Boost Converter with Overcurrent Protection (MATLAB)

Description

Simulink model of a DC-DC Buck-Boost Converter with integrated overcurrent protection. It regulates output voltage (step-up/down) and disables switching when current exceeds a safe limit.

Features
	•	Step-up/down voltage control using PWM
	•	Real-time overcurrent detection and shutdown
	•	Stable under dynamic load conditions

Requirements
	•	MATLAB + Simulink (R2020b or later)
	•	Simscape Electrical (optional)

Applications

Battery-powered systems, portable DC converters, power electronics labs
